# SKANI Utility - Original Request

Please implement a SKANI utility that will, given a directory a fasta files with genome sequences, compute sketches for those genomes, store the sketches in a local cache, and enable users to compute SKANI distances between input genome sequences and all the genomes for which sketches were computed.
